This neural network is used to detect handwritten numbers
<br/>
• Implemented a Neural Network to find handwritten digits with 80% accuracy using Tensorflow and Keras
<br/>
• Preprocessed data with normalization and reshaped it to prepare the handwritten digit images for input to the neural network
<br/>
• Systematically tuned hyperparameters, including learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization terms, to enhance performance
